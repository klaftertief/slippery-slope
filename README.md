# Slippery slope

A slippy map library written in pure Elm.

## Notice

_This library is in an early development stage. The API and feature set is subject to change. After some time of testing and feedback it will be published under a separate GitHub organisation with a new name._

## Overview

This library makes it easy to integrate slippy maps in Elm applications. It's written in pure Elm, so there is no need for any JS<->Elm interop.
It offers many features to create custom maps and to render different types of data. It also provides an API to extend the map with new types of layers.
